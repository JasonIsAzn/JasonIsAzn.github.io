                <h1>AboutMe</h1>
                <p>I'm a Computer Science student at Texas A&M. I'm studying at Texas A&M and will graudate the year 2024. One of the reasons why I choose to study Computer Science is because computer science gives to the ability to make things based on your imagination. While this is my first website and I'm limited by my own skills. This website shows my ability to learn and create things. This is my website to showcase what I have learned in college and the skills or projects I have worked on throughout the years. There are three main componets to my website. The different sections can be located on the navigation bar at the top of the website. The first component is my projects I have worked on. There are three main projects: Billy Discrod Bot, Sypha, and Python101 Course. The second compoent is my skills, where my main skills are list at the very top and addition skills are listed at the bottom. The final component is my services where I have three organization I have volunteered for. This website is also my first time creating a website and I learned a lot from web development. In addition to learning html, css, and javascript, I also want to explore other packages or version of web development like React. </p>
